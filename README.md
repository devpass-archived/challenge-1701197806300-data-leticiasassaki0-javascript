# JavaScript Data Structures Challenge
In this challenge, you are required to implement three data structures in JavaScript: a Stack, a Queue, and a LinkedList.

For each data structure, you need to provide the following methods:

1. `push` (Stack) / `enqueue` (Queue) - add an element to the data structure
2. `pop` (Stack) / `dequeue` (Queue) - remove and return the top element from the data structure
3. `isEmpty` - check if the data structure is empty
4. `size` - get the number of elements in the data structure

You can provide additional methods if you think they are necessary.

## Setup
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to run the tests and validate your data structures.
